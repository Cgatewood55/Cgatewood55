        <h3>Week 1 Blog</h3>
        <section>
            <p>
             The first week class I came I can say I learned more than I thought. In the beginning I had some computer malfunctions that set me back a little with a few projects., but was still able to keep up to speed with what was going on. HTML and CSS were the first topics we covered. More of a refreshener from treehouse to me. I feel comfortable with HTML and setting up the beginning structure. I understand CSS but not as comfortable with it like HTML.. I struggled with understanding github when first going through processes. I feel like I was just over thinking it a bit but a little one on one time with lauren got me up to speed. I learned a lot of new CSS methods that I didn't know before and now able to make a basic web-page. One thing I wish one had told me before I started was to GET A MAC COMPUTER!
