        <h3>Week 1 Blog</h3>
        <section>
            <p>
             The first week class I came I can say I learned more than I thought. In the beginning I had some computer malfunctions that set me back a little with a few projects., but was still able to keep up to speed with what was going on. HTML and CSS were the first topics we covered. More of a refreshener from treehouse to me. I feel comfortable with HTML and setting up the beginning structure. I understand CSS but not as comfortable with it like HTML.. I struggled with understanding github when first going through processes. I feel like I was just over thinking it a bit but a little one on one time with lauren got me up to speed. I learned a lot of new CSS methods that I didn't know before and now able to make a basic web-page. One thing I wish one had told me before I started was to GET A MAC COMPUTER!

            <h3>Week 2 blog JS</h3>
            <p>Week 2 we started learning more about javascript. We went over writing for loops that loop through an array of objects  and how to make functions. At first the for loop process  was pretty challenging for me. My main thing was making sure I all the correct syntax. After doing a few loops on the group project we were assigned to do, it became a more clear to me. I wish I could've went back over some treehouse lessons in mor deph. I feel that would've made things alot clear for me.</p>
